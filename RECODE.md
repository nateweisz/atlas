# The Recode
When I was initially starting this project I had one goal in mind, use websockets in some aspect of this project but what I didn't consider was the entire deployment system. 

## How
The recode will be removing all the modules except server and just using server to deploy to kubernetes nodes. The application will be much smaller and more straightforward and I will be able to work on the other features like user login.
